All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
## [0.2.8] - 2024-2-22
### Added
### Fixed
- Pehkui is no longer a hard requirement and the game won't crash without it. 

## [0.2.7] - 2024-02-22
### Added
### Fixed
- Pokemon Spawned from a rogue spawner now pull their catchability from config. Currently either true or false, and defaults to false. These should probably be some kind of reward for killing them.
  - Would like to implement rates in a future update.
- PokeBosses have a Bosses/.json file for each vanilla dimension even though they're all the same. This allows spawns in each dimension.
- Non-Boss pokemon should now have their health recalculated
- Spawner PokeBosses should now have their health recalculated
- PokeBosses should have their health recalculated properly too
- Glowing is now set after the entity is added and should theoretically only be set after the pokemon is confirmed to be a boss.
### Changed
- Moved all Pokemon Class mixins to one mixin file as they were not platform independent
- Other Cleanup!!
### Borked
- _Technically_, tiny pokemon not being able to step up blocks is a pehkui things. I'd like to mixin to have a minimum pokemon step height, but for now just modify the server config and set the minimum step height to like .5
- Pehkui is apparently a hard requirement. Going to try and figure out how to fix that.
- 

## [0.2.6] - 2024-02-21
### Added
- Config for levels of pokemon bosses
### Fixed
- Hitboxes Again? So long as things are working mostly fine we may just mark it as a known issue
- Fabric Config Files weren't populating. Added event subscription to reload the config after all the mods have loaded.
### Changed
- Build files
- Other things (there was a lot - check the commits)
- Cleaned up prior to release!
### Borked
- Pokemon Bosses currently use about all the same stats in the json
- With fightorflight and apotheosis, pokemon bosses don't search out the player same as other bosses when the TargetNearestPlayer config is enabled
  - Pokemon Bosses ALSO only aggro according to the rules fightorflight implemented. Plan to include fixes in the next major version.
- Pokemon Nicknames that are longer than 12 characters render past the edges of their fields in any place where the nickname is rendered and cut off. Not quite sure how to fix this but it's known.
- Cancelled pokemon glow for a split second before the effect is cancelled. May need to be cancelled sooner.
- Cancelled pokemon retain their recalculated boss health
- Non cancelled bosses don't have their health recalculated
- Spawner boss pokemon don't have their max health recalculated
- Spawner Boss Pokemon are catchable. Since they're random, this is OP.
- Reaaallly small pokemon can't go up full blocks. Makes bosses easy to cheese. Want all pokemon to always be able to at least go up 1 full block.

## [0.2.5] - 2024-02-20
### Added
- New Logo! Yay!
### Fixed
- Affix Item Drop Rate?
- Entity data for pokemon bosses not being reset properly after the pokemon is reset
  - I think I got most of it fixed too.
- Pokemon Nicknames keep their colors now when set through Apotheosis. Unfortunately, won't work with other ways.
- Hitboxes are getting close!!!
### Changed
- New Config file for purely Cobblemon modifications
- Still trying to fix hitbox problems
- Removed quark logic (for now) and cleaned up files! First true release is upcoming!
### Borked


## [0.2.4] - 2024-02-19
### Added
### Fixed
- Apotheosis things should now properly check if apotheosis compat/config settings are enabled. Pehkui too if those didn't.
### Changed
- Updated config to allow a separated configurable Pokemon Boss Spawn Rate. And updated the logic to go with it.
- Modified a TON of the Pehkui logic and implemented the config for specifically allowing bosses to be larger. May actually make bosses random sized too so may need double checked.
- Made a couple Apotheosis Config values float ranges rather than booleans
### Borked
- Hitbox Problems
- Pokemon are dropping named affix items when they shouldn't be.

## [0.2.3] - 2024-02-15
### Added
### Fixed 
- Config Reloading for Forge, at least. Implemented logic that may work for Fabric as well once I figure out how fabric handles that event.
### Changed
- Added logic to see if we can pass the Rarity back to the BossEvents for making differing text for when a boss spawns
- Trying to resolve pokemon nickname renaming and recoloring problems
### Borked
- Nickname color STILL gets reset when the pokemon is renamed as soon as the name is changed. It actually may be as soon as the pokemon gets focus.


## [0.2.2] - 2024-02-15

### Fixed
- Sophisticated Storage Spam. Also tested it up to 64 blocks.
## [0.2.1] - 2024-02-15
### Added
### Fixed
- Pokemon Bosses now correctly spawn! They only spawn within the spawn range percentage defined within Adventure.cfg
- Potentially will create a new config option for pokemon specific spawn percentage chance.
### Changed
### Borked
- Pokemon Hitbox sizes are still not mapping right. Possibly re-call the pokemon's set eye height? May also be fixed by fixing apotheosis height code?
- Sophisticated Storage plugins _work_ but cause a TON of log spam, so changing the implementation.
- Configs still can't be reloaded and the game has to be restarted :(


## [0.2.0] - 2024-02-14

### Added
- Apotheosis Pokemon Bosses Spawn Properly - kind of. Some pokemon spawn as bosses but aren't supposed to.
- > Pokemon can drop affix items and gems based on config.
- > Boss sizes scale based on config. Unsure if this works with normal bosses.
- Sophisticated Core functionality to make Controller Search Range based on config - UNTESTED
- 
### Fixed
- Apotheosis Issues with pokemon bosses not spawning AS bosses or with items

### Changed
- Updated TODO file! YAY!

## [0.1.3] - 2024-02-09

### Added

- Everything!
- Pehkui Integration for Fabric and Forge
- Apotheosis Integration for Forge
- Pokemon Music Disks: “ENLS’s Pre-Looped Music Library” extending Quark's Ambient Disks (ish)
-
